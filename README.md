============

Various scripts and settings I have in my home folder.

tools/qwe.sh
------------

A tool to bookmark the current folder you are in. Stores a list of folders in a dot file in your home directory. You bookmark the folder by giving it a short tag, then you can travel to it by using the tag. Just add `source qwe.sh` to your `.bashrc` or other profile dot-files to make it work.

```sh
Usage:
qwe name : Traverse to directory tagged name
qwe -h : Help
qwe -l : List of saved tags
qwe -a name : Add a tag called name with the current folder
qwe -d name : Remove a tag called name
qwe -p name : Print the directory tagged with name
```

tools/extract.sh
----------------

Extracts most filetypes

```
Usage:
extract filename
```

tools/search.sh
---------------

Searches for a file from a directory or the root

```sh
Usage:
search [dir] [search_parameter]
```

bin/hist
--------

Greps the "infitite history" folder that is set in the `.bashrc` file

bin/imgur-upload.sh
-------------------

Uploads to imgur the given filename, returns the url and the delete url.

Depends on curl mostly. Check the source for more tools it uses.

bin/import-imgur
----------------

Uses the Image Magick import to create an image at a specified path, then uses `imgur-upload.sh` to upload that image to imgur.

Useful for taking a screenshot and get an imgur link with one command.

Dot Files
---------

`.Xefaults`  
Nothing fancy here, just a simple color scheme.

`.tmux.conf`  
Only interesting thing is Shift + left / Shift + right to traverse tabs in tmux

`.vimrc`  
4 space tabs setting I use for vim.
